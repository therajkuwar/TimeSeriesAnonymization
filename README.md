# Anonymization of Time Series Data Using Markov Chains  

This project explores anonymization techniques for time series data using **Markov chains** to balance **data privacy** and **utility**.  

## üìå Features  
- **Discretization of continuous time series data** into distinct states.  
- **Markov chain modeling** for anonymization.  
- **Evaluation of privacy and utility metrics**.  
- **Comparison with existing anonymization techniques**.  

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- `data/` - Contains raw and processed datasets.  
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.  
- `src/` - Implementation of anonymization algorithms.  
- `docs/` - Project documentation and reports.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/therajkuwar/TimeSeriesAnonymization
   cd TimeSeriesAnonymization
